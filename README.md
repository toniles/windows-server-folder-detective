**üîç Uncover storage hogs on your Windows systems with ease!**

**Windows Folder Detective** is a PowerShell script that swiftly analyzes your drives, pinpointing large folders and helping you reclaim valuable disk space. Ideal for both casual users and enterprise environments, it's especially useful for **Windows Server** where finding free tier tools can be challenging.

## üéØ Key Features

- **üöÄ Lightning-fast analysis** with dynamic parallel processing (on PowerShell 7+)
- **üìä Real-time progress tracking** while analyzing thousands of folders
- **üóÇÔ∏è Instant detection and reporting** of folders taking up more than 1GB
- **üíª Compatible with** Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 and newer
- **üõ†Ô∏è Works in older versions of PowerShell** with legacy sequential processing

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- **PowerShell** version 5.1+ for legacy mode, **PowerShell 7+** for parallel processing.
- **Administrator privileges** are required to access system folders and run the script.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Script

1. **Clone the repository** or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/windows-folder-detective.git
   cd windows-folder-detective
   ```

2. Run the script in PowerShell with administrator privileges:

   ```powershell
   ./FolderDetective.ps1
   ```

   Example for analyzing C:\ drive:

   ```powershell
   $Path = "C:\"
   ./FolderDetective.ps1 -Path $Path
   ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Output

- **Progress**: Real-time progress shown in the console as it analyzes folders.
- **Results**: Folders larger than 1GB are listed in the terminal and saved to a CSV file called `LargeFolders.csv`.

## üí° How It Works

Windows Folder Detective performs a recursive scan of the specified path, excluding critical system directories (like C:\Windows, Program Files, etc.). It identifies folders larger than 1GB and outputs the results in a CSV file and a formatted table within the terminal.

**Dual-mode processing:**

- **PowerShell 7+**: Utilizes parallel processing to significantly speed up the analysis of large file systems.
- **PowerShell 5.1 and below**: Uses sequential processing to ensure compatibility with older environments.

## üìä Example Output

```
Obteniendo la lista de carpetas...
Total de carpetas a analizar: 3554
PowerShell 7 detectado. Utilizando procesamiento en paralelo.

Carpeta grande encontrada: C:\Example\BigFolder - 12.34 GB
Carpeta grande encontrada: C:\Example\AnotherFolder - 8.76 GB

An√°lisis completado. Total de carpetas analizadas: 3554
```

The `LargeFolders.csv` will look like this:

| Path | Size |
|------|------|
| C:\Example\BigFolder | 12.34 GB |
| C:\Example\AnotherFolder | 8.76 GB |

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

- **Path Parameter**: You can specify any drive or folder path to analyze:

  ```powershell
  $Path = "D:\"
  ./FolderDetective.ps1 -Path $Path
  ```

- **Excluded Folders**: The script automatically excludes critical system directories, such as:
  - C:\Windows
  - C:\Program Files
  - C:\ProgramData
  - C:\Users\[User]\AppData
